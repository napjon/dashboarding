# Overview

Try to implementing Jupyter dashboard from Plotly dash, https://github.com/plotly/dash:

Plotly dash is deprecated. Instead dash 2.0 is built around the premise that it will simplify the implementation code. Because dash 2.0 seems slowly implemented, Jupyter Dashboard is used. Jupyter Dashboard has shown great promise. There's a great documentation at this repo, https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/dashboards.

In the next couple of weeks, plotly implementation will be used first. It's very easy to use.

Current Status:

* Plotly has issue with showing GraphWidget in Jupyter Notebook version 4.2+. See the issue [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/490). The notebook has finished implementing Jupyter Dashboard, but need to upgrade to 4.2 to use Jupyter Server.
